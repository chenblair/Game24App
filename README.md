Description:

Play the classic 24 game, a fun math game where the goal is to make 24 out of 4 given numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. By default, the numbers are integers from 1 to 10. For an extra challenge, enable fraction mode, which makes some numbers start as fractions. Puzzles are randomly generated and guaranteed to be solvable, allowing for endless play. If you ever get stuck, try a hint to push you in the right direction.

Includes three distinct game modes:
- Free Play: Play at your own pace (puzzles are saved)
- Timed Play: Solve as many as you can in 5 minutes
- Multiplayer: Compete with a friend to solve the same puzzles

How to play:
To perform an operation, tap two numbers and an operation. The order you tap them does not matter except for division, where the first number tapped is divided by the second. Try to figure out a way to use all four numbers exactly once to get 24.
